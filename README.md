# LDMOES
This project provides the complete code implementation of LDMOES, which integrates UNet-based diffusion models, multi-objective evolutionary search, and knowledge distillation to optimize architectures for reduced MACs and enhanced generation performance. The code includes training, evaluation, and architecture search pipelines.
