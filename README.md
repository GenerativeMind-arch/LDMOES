# LDMOES
This project provides the complete code implementation of LDMOES. The proposed method is the first to apply multi-objective evolutionary search to optimize the backbone architecture of UNet-based diffusion models. It further incorporates knowledge distillation to compress the model, effectively reducing the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) while enhancing generation performance. The project covers the full pipeline of training, evaluation, and architecture search, offering strong reproducibility and extensibility.
